// Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
// test logic needs is declared.
//
// Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.

#include <limits.h>
#include "../../metrics/utils.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
namespace {

// Step 2. Use the TEST macro to define your tests.
//
// TEST has two parameters: the test case name and the test name.
// After using the macro, you should define your test logic between a
// pair of braces.  You can use a bunch of macros to indicate the
// success or failure of a test.  EXPECT_TRUE and EXPECT_EQ are
// examples of such macros.  For a complete list, see gtest.h.
//
// <TechnicalDetails>
//
// In Google Test, tests are grouped into test cases.  This is how we
// keep test code organized.  You should put logically related tests
// into the same test case.
//
// The test case name and the test name should both be valid C++
// identifiers.  And you should not use underscore (_) in the names.
//
// Google Test guarantees that each test you define is run exactly
// once, but it makes no guarantee on the order the tests are
// executed.  Therefore, you should write your tests in such a way
// that their results don't depend on their order.
//

// Tests that the date given is correct
TEST(UtilsTest,GetDate) {
  int firstVal = (int) (*getDate().begin()) - '0';
  EXPECT_LE(firstVal, 3);
}
